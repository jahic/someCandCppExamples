## Mandelbrot

This OpenCV programm creates a Mandelbrot (Fractal). It uses parallelize_for for OpenCV to parallelize sequential code. For reference, both parallel and sequential versions are provided. As an output, programm shows to images and the times for their creation. In the end, speedup factor is calculated.
